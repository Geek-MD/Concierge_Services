# Concierge Services

**Concierge Services** is a custom integration for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) that allows you to manage utility bills (electricity, water, gas, etc.) received by email. The integration automatically detects services, extracts information from emails, and creates devices and sensors for each service with billing data.

> **🇨🇱 Geographic scope — Chile only (for now)**
> Concierge Services is currently designed and tested exclusively for Chilean utility service accounts (Aguas Andinas, Enel, etc.). Billing email formats, field labels, and patterns are tuned for Chilean providers. Support for other countries may be added in the future.

## ⚙️ Configuration

All configuration is done through the user interface:

### Step 1: IMAP Credentials

1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
2. Click the **+ Add Integration** button
3. Search for **Concierge Services**
4. Enter your email account details:
   - **IMAP Server**: Your IMAP email server
   - **IMAP Port**: The IMAP port (default: `993`)
   - **Email**: Your email address
   - **Password**: Your password or app password

### Step 2: Finalize Setup

After validating credentials, configure:
- **Friendly Name**: A descriptive name for this integration (e.g., "Home Bills", "Casa Principal")

### Step 3: Add Service Devices

Once the integration is set up, add utility services one by one using the **ADD DEVICE** button
on the integration card:
- The integration scans your inbox and detects available service providers
- Select a service to add it as a device
- Repeat for each service you want to track
- Each service can be reconfigured later via its device page

> **Note**: Only one Concierge Services instance is allowed per Home Assistant installation
> (`single_config_entry`). To monitor a different email account, reconfigure the existing
> entry using the **CONFIGURE** button.
